ITC-Hardware

This github was created to earn course points in the Introduction to Computers and Informatics course taught in the Estonian IT College. Any code written for a College project will be uploaded onto this git repository.
The repository was made by a student of EITC, Oliver Aasmets.

Should you wish to contact the author, approach him in person or send him a pigeon with your written message on a piece of parchment tied around the pigeon's leg.

The code on this repository must be used responsibly and only after anyone wishing to use it consults the copyright license, also uploaded onto this repository. Aleksander Suur is preferred.

Theoretically, all the code here should be made by the creator of this repository.

Let us take assume that this project has been edited a few times over the past few day or days.
